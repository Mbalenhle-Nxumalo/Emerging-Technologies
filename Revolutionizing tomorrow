Revolutionizing Tomorrow
In the ever-evolving business landscape, digital transformation stands as the linchpin for organizational success. It embodies the infusion of cutting-edge technologies into every facet of operations, revolutionizing how businesses function and deliver value to customers. Yet, this revolution isn't without its challenges. Legacy systems, employee reluctance, skill gaps, security concerns, and leadership ambiguities often impede the seamless execution of digital transformation initiatives.
Digital transformation refers to integrating digital technologies into all aspects of an organization, fundamentally changing how it operates and delivers value to customers. It involves adopting advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, data analytics, and automation to enhance business processes, improve efficiency, and create innovative products or services. In today's fast-evolving business landscape, digital transformation is crucial for organizations to stay competitive, adapt to changing market dynamics, and meet customers' growing demands and expectations. However, implementing digital transformation initiatives can be challenging due to various factors.
Several obstacles hinder the smooth implementation of digital transformation in organizations. Legacy systems and infrastructure pose compatibility issues, while employee resistance to change, a lack of digital skills, concerns about data security, and a lack of clear strategy and leadership further complicate the process.
To navigate these challenges in 2024 and ensure successful digital transformation, organizations can adopt specific strategies:
Develop a Comprehensive Strategy: Craft a well-defined roadmap outlining the transformation objectives, timelines, and key milestones. Involving stakeholders across the organization ensures alignment and commitment.
Invest in Employee Training: Prioritize continuous learning and development programs to equip the workforce with necessary digital skills. Empowered employees are more likely to embrace and drive the transformation.
Modernize Infrastructure Incrementally: Rather than abrupt changes, adopt an incremental approach to update systems and infrastructure. Agile methodologies enable gradual integration while maintaining compatibility.
Focus on Cybersecurity: Establish robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard data and systems. Encryption, routine security assessments, and employee awareness programs mitigate risks associated with digital transformation.

Generally, studies have shown a positive relationship between ICTs and economic growth (Jorgenson and Vu, 2016; Niebel, 2018; Romer, 1990). In Africa, the economic liberalisation policies of the 1980s, egged on by international financial institutions (Babb and Kentikelenis, 2018; van Klyton et al., 2019, coincided with the start of ICT investments and internet infrastructure, resulting in the widespread diffusion of ICT products and services on the continent (Chavula, 2013; Evans, 2019; Ojong, 2016). These efforts included the privatisation of telecommunication lines (Warf, 2010) and the consolidation of various ICT services under a single ministry (Holden and van.Klyton, 2016). In addition, Africa experienced a significant increase in the number of mobile phone subscribers, rising from 247 million from 1998 to 2008 to 367 million subscribers by 2015. This has been accompanied by an increase in broadband internet penetration rates from zero to 19 million between 2000 and 2010 (Ojong, 2016).

Despite investment efforts, African countries have faltered in reaping the expected economic prosperity associated with digitalisation because of a persistent digital divide, including digital skills shortages, deficits in ICT infrastructure, and high-cost structures (Banga and Velde, 2018; Melia, 2020; Yoon, 2020). For example, Counted and Arawole (2016) showed how internet inequality in Africa created major challenges for millennial digital entrepreneurs. In fact, African-based businesses are often subjected to restrictions in using certain global e-payment and web hosting services simply because “they are operating from certain African countries” (UNIGF, 2017; Meeting Archives).2 Finally, digitalisation has brought with it some negative consequences, including structural unemployment (Bührer and Hagist, 2017; Rifkin, 2015; UNCTAD, 2017; Valenduc; Vendramin, 2017). Hence, nation-states must align their national workforce in accordance with the demands of a new digital landscape.

There are three lacunae in the literature that this study aims to fill regarding the relationship between digitalisation and economic growth. First, the preponderance of qualitative digitalisation studies (e.g., Dewa et al., 2018; Grunig, 2009) may not fully enable the causal effects of digitalisation on productivity to be established. Second, despite the established link between digital infrastructure and productivity in several studies (Baquero Forero, 2013; Castellacci, 2011; Evangelista et al., 2014), there is a deficit of knowledge about this relationship for African countries, particularly regarding the impact of the usage of digital technology on economic growth, employment, and trade (Myovella et al., 2020). In fact, Wamboye et al. (2015) called for more research to be conducted on these relationships in an African context due to the rapid growth in ICT and the use of cellular technology in the expansion of digital financial transactions.

Finally, previous studies such as Evangelista et al. (2014) and Counted and Arawole (2016) have suggested that ICT usage rather than access is what matters for economic growth without distinguishing between the impacts of individual, business and government ICT usage in a comparative context.3 This leads to the following research question: which type of ICT usage constitutes a robust determinant of economic growth? To answer this question, we conducted a quantitative, empirical analysis on a panel of 39 African countries using a System Generalised Methods of Moment (SYSGMM) estimator from 2012 to 2016. The measure of digitalisation employed here is represented by the Networked Readiness Index (NRI), a broad measure that captures access to, readiness for, and usage of digital technology. We restrict our analysis to the usage sub-index of the NRI and its fundamental pillars. Although the NRI has existed for 16 years, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have comparatively analysed individual, business, and government usages to estimate the impact of disaggregated forms of usage on economic growth. Therefore, the contribution of this study is in distinguishing and assessing the individual impacts of three types of ICT usage (individual, business, and government usage) on economic growth.

Our main finding is that individual usage of digital technology, rather than business or government usage, yields a significant impact on economic growth for African countries. In addition, we further disaggregate the usage sub-index to show that social media and the importance of ICTs to government vision are positively associated with economic growth. . The article proceeds with a review of the literature on the relationship between ICT and economic growth. After which, we discuss the methodology and data sources. The findings are then presented and discussed, followed by final remarks and policy recommendations.
